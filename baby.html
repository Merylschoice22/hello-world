<p>Time for me to go to bed, <br>
Hope I don't wake up instead.<br>
As I lay, I'm <strong>missing you</strong>, <br>
In the big arms of my boo. <br>
Tomorrow I can hold you tight, <br>
Don't <strong><em>squeeze</em></strong> too hard, I just might. <br>
So into dreamland now I fall, <br>
Ready to escape it all. <br>
The best thing would be pleasant dreams, <br>
And not wake up with <strong>piercing screams</strong>.<br>
So wish me luck now as I go,<br>
Until we meet again, tomorrow.<br> </p>
